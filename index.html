                <u>What is Git?</u>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.  We can use git to keep track of updates, additions, and deletions to our code.  It's used for code backups, preventing loss of hours and/or days of work.  Git also helps keep history of updates, acts as online storage, and minimize errors, while handling multiple codes.

                <u>What is Javascript?</u>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                JavaScript, also known as JS, is a programming language created for the web, when applied to an HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document, can provide interactivity on websites. HTML is the content of the page, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the information about how the HTML contents of the page should be displayed,  and JavaScript allows the page to react to user inputs (Clicking, scrolling, etc.) as well as other events. In a nutshell, JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language supporting prototype based object construction. 
            </p>

            <p>
                JavaScript can function as both a procedural and an object oriented language. Objects are created programmatically in JavaScript, by attaching methods and properties to otherwise empty objects at run time, as opposed to the syntactic class definitions common in compiled languages like C++ and Java. Once an object has been constructed it can be used as a blueprint (or prototype) for creating similar objects.

            <p>
                <u>What are variables?</u>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Variables are stored in the computers memory system, RAM. If we want to to go into a specific place within the file system, we would then look at the keyword of the variable, called a declaration. Javascript has three kinds of variable declarations. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <code>var</code>
                <code>let</code>
                <code>const</code>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <code>var data; </code> 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The word "var" is the variable and "data" is the declaration. We can then assign a value to the variable. Assignment is the term used for the declared variable.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <code>var data=7;</code>
            </p>

            <p>
                There are different data types we can assign to a declared variable, such as Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Undefined, Null, and NaN (not a number).

        <section id="data_types" class="main-section">

            <header><strong>Data Types</strong></header>

            <p>
                There is one number type in JS, that’s called Numbers. If a value of type “number”, it can be positive, negative, an integer, or a floating point (decimal). Number types have three symbolic values: +Infinity, -Infinity, and NAN. For Example:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <code>console.log(4 + 5);</code> 
                <br/>
                We can easily see that 9 will be logged to the console. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <code>console.log(4 + undefined);</code>
                <br/>
                Now we logged NAN to the console. NAN is a way for JS to say “I think you meant to have a number here, but I can’t produce a number with that you gave me, so here is NAN”.

<!-- - User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world"). -->

<!-- - User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header. -->

<!-- - User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user. -->

<!-- - User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query. -->
