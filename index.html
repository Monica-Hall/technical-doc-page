                <u>What is Git?</u>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.  We can use git to keep track of updates, additions, and deletions to our code.  It's used for code backups, preventing loss of hours and/or days of work.  Git also helps keep history of updates, acts as online storage, and minimize errors, while handling multiple codes.

                <u>What is Javascript?</u>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                JavaScript, also known as JS, is a programming language created for the web, when applied to an HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document, can provide interactivity on websites. HTML is the content of the page, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the information about how the HTML contents of the page should be displayed,  and JavaScript allows the page to react to user inputs (Clicking, scrolling, etc.) as well as other events. In a nutshell, JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language supporting prototype based object construction. 
            </p>

            <p>
                JavaScript can function as both a procedural and an object oriented language. Objects are created programmatically in JavaScript, by attaching methods and properties to otherwise empty objects at run time, as opposed to the syntactic class definitions common in compiled languages like C++ and Java. Once an object has been constructed it can be used as a blueprint (or prototype) for creating similar objects.

<!-- - User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world"). -->

<!-- - User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header. -->

<!-- - User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user. -->

<!-- - User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query. -->
